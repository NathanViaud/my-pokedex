title: Charizard
---
Charizard is a Fire/Flying type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

Charizard is a large dragon-like Pokémon, mainly orange in color. It has two large wings, the underside of which are turquoise. Like Charmander and Charmeleon, it has a flame at the end of its tail.

The design of Charizard appears to draw inspiration from dragons of European folklore, with its large wings, horned head, and fiery breath.

Charizard is notable for being the final evolution stage of one of the original starter Pokémon, along with Venusaur and Blastoise. Although it looks like a dragon, it doesn't have the Dragon typing. However it has two Mega Evolutions, available in Generation 6 games and Pokémon Go, one of which replaces its Flying type with Dragon. Charizard also has a Gigantamax form available in Pokémon Sword/Shield, with an exclusive G-Max move, G-Max Wildfire.
