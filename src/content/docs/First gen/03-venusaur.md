title: Venusaur

Venusaur is a Grass/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

Venusaur is a large, quadrupedal Pokémon with a turquoise body. It has small red eyes and several large ferns on its back and head. The plant bulb that was on the back of its previous evolutions, Bulbasaur and Ivysaur, has now bloomed into a large flower with large pink petals and a yellow center. The female has a seed in the center.

Venusaur is inspired by toads and the horned frog. The large flower is similar to the Rafflesia arnoldii, a parasitic plant with an unpleasant odor, referencing the Pokémon's Poison type.

Venusaur is notable for being the final evolution stage of one of the original starter Pokémon, along with Charizard and Blastoise. It has a Mega Evolution, available in Generation 6 games and Pokémon Go; it also has a Gigantamax form available in Pokémon Sword/Shield, with an exclusive G-Max move, G-Max Vine Lash.
