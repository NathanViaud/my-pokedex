Squirtle is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

Squirtle is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. It has a blue body with purple eyes, a light brown belly, and a tough red-brown shell on its back. It has a long tail that curls into a spiral.

Squirtle is primarily based on a turtle, taking inspiration from both land-dwelling and sea-dwelling varieties. The curly tail resembles a crashing wave.

Squirtle is notable for being one of the three choices for a starter Pokémon in the original Game Boy games, Pokémon Red & Blue (Red & Green in Japan), along with Bulbasaur and Charmander.
