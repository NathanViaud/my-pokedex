title: Blastoise

Blastoise is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

Blastoise is a large, bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. It has a blue body with small purple eyes, a light brown belly, and a stubby tail. It has a large brown shell with two powerful water cannons on either side, which can be withdrawn.

Blastoise's design is heavily influenced by turtles and tortoises. The cannons likely draw inspiration from the concept of a mobile tank or battleship.

Blastoise is notable for being the final evolution stage of one of the original starter Pokémon, along with Venusaur and Charizard. It has a Mega Evolution, available in Generation 6 games and Pokémon Go; it also has a Gigantamax form available in Pokémon Sword/Shield, with an exclusive G-Max move, G-Max Cannonade.
