title: Bulbasaur
---
Bulbasaur is a Grass/Poison type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

Bulbasaur is a small, mainly turquoise amphibian Pokémon with red eyes and a green bulb on its back. It is based on a frog/toad, with the bulb resembling a plant bulb that grows into a flower as it evolves.

Bulbasaur is notable for being the very first Pokémon in the National Pokédex. It is one of the three choices for a starter Pokémon in the original Game Boy games, Pokémon Red & Blue (Red & Green in Japan), along with Charmander and Squirtle.
