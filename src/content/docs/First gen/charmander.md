title: Charmander
---
Charmander is a Fire type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. Most of its body is colored orange, while its underbelly is light yellow and it has blue eyes. It has a flame at the end of its tail, which is said to signify its health.

Charmander's design is based on a lizard, however as its name suggests it may also have been inspired by salamanders, which in mythology have an affinity with fire.

Charmander is notable for being one of the three choices for a starter Pokémon in the original Game Boy games, Pokémon Red & Blue (Red & Green in Japan), along with Bulbasaur and Squirtle.
